        - Add options --files-with-matches (-l) and --files-without-match (-L).
          Also note that starting from now, AppBase::Grep might pass an
          `$instruction` argument to the source callback, which can have the
          value of 1 to mean to skip to the next "file" (or source). When a
          source is unaware of this and keep returning the remaining lines of
          the same "file"/source, `-l` mgiht report multiple lines of the same
          filename.
